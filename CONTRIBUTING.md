# Wanna contribute 🤝??

Here are the simple steps for contributing to this repo

  - **READ CODE OF CONDUCT**
     
     Read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/clubgamma/code-of-conduct) before starting contributing.

  - **Fork the repo**
    
    First of all fork the repo to your own GitHub account by clicking the **Fork** button on top-right corner. Still could not find 🙄,check the below image
    ![fork](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58077762/93772626-ac77ef80-fc3c-11ea-8ee6-e381e1d68280.png)
    After a sucessful fork, you'll see a copy of this repo in your own account.

  - **Clone the repo**
    
    Now it's time to copy this repo to own laptop/PC. 
    To clone the repo you can write the below command in **Git Bash**
    
    > git clone <REPO_LINK_FROM_YOUR_ACCOUNT>
    
    You can get the repo link from the Download section in the **repo copied in your own account**. Still having trouble🙄,see the below image

  - **Set up remote repo**
    
      - When you cloned your fork, that should have automatically set your fork as the "origin" remote. Use git remote -v to show your current remotes. You should see the URL of your fork (which you copied in step 3) next to the word "origin". 
        If you don't see an "origin" remote, you can add it using below git command
    
        > git remote add origin <REPO_LINK_FROM_YOUR_ACCOUNT>
      
      - Now you have to setup **upstream**. For that write the below git command
      
        > git remote add upstream https://github.com/clubgamma/Awesome-Web-Art
        
      - Now pull the latest changes from original repo to your local changes by firing thee below command
        
        > git pull upstream master
            
  - **It's Code Time now**
    
      - First of all, make a folder with named as your GitHub username and this is compulsory.
